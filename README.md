# iterake

## Overview
iterake performs an algorithm called iterative raking to generate row/respondent level weights for a sample of data. Iterative raking (also known as rim weighting), is one of several methods used to correct the deviation between the *marginal* proportions in your sample from a known population for a given set of variables.

Three workhorse functions are inluded to help at every stage of the data weighting process:
* `pre_weight()` compares the unweighted data to the population model.
* `iterake()` performs the iterative raking.
* `post_weight()` evaluates the effects of the weighting model.

This package was built to play nicely with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), so the API should feel somewhat familiar to users of tidy tools.

## Motivating Example
Suppose you've sampled 200 individuals from your home town to perform a study on used car buyers. In our omniscience, we know characteristics about age, gender, and the vehicle type owned in the population from which we are sampling.
