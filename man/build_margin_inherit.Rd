\title{Create weighting category from data}
\usage{
build_margin_inherit(name, df, prev.wgt)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name given to weighting category, character. Must have exact match in the column names of data you intend to weight.}

\item{df}{Data frame containing data you intend to weight.}

\item{prev.wgt}{Variable name of weight used to calculate bucket proportions in \code{`df`}.}
}
\value{
A nested \code{tibble} with special class \code{build_margin}.
}
\description{
To be fed into \code{universe()}, this function creates an individual weighting category. (E.g., age group.)
Unlike \code{build_margin()}, this function creates bucket targets from a dataframe instead of being directly assigned.
}
\examples{
data(weight_me)

build_margin_inherit(
  name = "costume",
  df = dplyr::filter(weight_me, satisfied == "No")
)

build_margin_inherit(
  name = "transport",
  df = dplyr::filter(weight_me, satisfied == "No"),
  prev.wgt = prev_weight
)

}
