Must have exact match in the column names of data to be weighted.}

\item{buckets}{Vector corresponding to the "buckets" in which your category can be classified.}

\item{targets}{Numeric vector of the proportions each element of \code{`buckets`} represents in the population.}

\item{sum.1}{Whether or not to force inputs to \code{`targets`} to sum to one.}
}
