\title{Compare unweighted or weighted data to targets}
\usage{
compare_margins(df, design, weight, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame of the data you intend on weighting.}

\item{design}{Full weighting design created by \code{universe()}.}

\item{weight}{Name of weight variable, optional.}

\item{plot}{Display plot, default = FALSE.}
}
\value{
A tibble of unweighted counts and proportions, difference between 
unweighted and target proportions. If \code{`weight`} is given, it also includes
weighted counts and proportions, difference between weighted and target proportions.
Optionally, a plot of this information.
}
\description{
Inspect by what degree the unweighted or weighted sample proportions deviate from the
target proportions.
